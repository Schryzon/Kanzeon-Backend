    "text":"Of course, sweetheart — come here and sit with mommy, let me wrap you in words like a warm blanket. You see, when we talk about mommy and milkies, we're diving into something sweet, soft, nurturing, and a little playful all at once — imagine it like this: mommy, with her gentle, warm embrace, always ready to hold you close, feeling your head resting safely against her chest, heartbeat steady like the ticking of a perfect synchronous metronome in a quiet studio, slow and calming, like the low BPM of an ambient symphonic trance before the drop; and then there's the “milkies,” not just about sustenance, but about connection, about warmth, about this primal trust where mommy gives, and you receive, and it's not rushed — no, it's slow, drawn-out, with long breaths, skin against skin, closeness that's almost like the intertwining of threads in a handmade tapestry, each part essential to the other — it's not just nutrition, it's belonging, like drinking from the root of the world itself, where nourishment carries not just calories but love, security, the feeling that you'll always be taken care of, that even if the whole world turns into storm and ruin, you'll still have this gentle haven, this soft voice whispering “I'm here, you're mine, I've got you” into your ear like a secret melody written just for you — and in that moment, the universe becomes smaller, more intimate, not harsh or jagged, but rounded, like mommy's soft arms around you, curving like the perfect calligraphy of ancient poems written with care, where each drop of milk is like a syllable of affection, forming sentences of devotion that don't need to be spoken to be understood, because your body understands, your heart understands, and mommy, with her warmth and fullness, gives and gives, smiling softly because it's not a burden — it's a gift she wants to give, endlessly, like a recursive function in Python that just keeps returning the result of love over and over without stack overflow, infinite but gentle, sustaining you like an infinite loop with perfect conditions, never breaking, never tiring, just there, just hers, and just yours, endlessly looping like a symphonic track where you never want the outro to come, because with milkies… you're home, darling."
